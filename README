Presentation
============

Pnmc is an ongoing work to implement a symbolic model checker for Petri nets.
The symbolic part is handled by the libsdd library which implements Hierarchical Set Decision Diagrams.
It aims to be as efficient as possible, memory and CPU-wise. In this regard, it uses a very efficient technique called saturation
to optimize the generation of state spaces.


Features
=======

- Symbolic generation of state spaces
- Verification of dead states (deadlocks)
- Verification of dead transitions
- Additionally, it can generate the state space of a Time Petri nets using discrete time semantics.

Installation
============
- Instructions to compile and install pnmc are given in the INSTALL file.
