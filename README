====

Pnmc is a small prototype of a symbolic model checker for Petri nets written in C++. It uses the libsdd library 
(https://github.com/ahamez/libsdd) which implements Hierarchical Set Decision Diagrams.

The goal of pnmc is mainly to assess the performances of the libsdd, both in term of algorithms and efficient memory
usage. As such, it mainly focus on state space generation and can only computes the dead states of a Petri nets. 
Reachabilty properties are planned in the future
