PNMC INSTALLATION

# Requirements

  * C++ compiler
    - clang >= 3.3
    - gcc >= 4.8
    - Other compilers might work, as long as they implement the C++11 standard

  * Libraries
    - libsdd (https://github.com/ahamez/libsdd)
      Note that the libsdd is header-only, and as such it does not need to be
      compiled.
    - Boost >= 1.55

  * Tools
    - cmake >= 2.8.10

# Compilation

  * Quick start
    $ mkdir build
    $ cmake /path/to/pnmc -DLIBSDD=/path/to/libsdd
    $ make
    $ make install

  * Available cmake variables to configure paths
    - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
    - BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost

  * Setting the compiler
    - CXX=/path/to/bin/compiler cmake ...
