PNMC INSTALLATION

# Requirements

  * C++ compiler
  - clang >= 3.3
  - gcc >= 4.8
  - Other compilers might work, as long as they implement the C++11 standard

  * Libraries
  - libsdd (https://github.com/ahamez/libsdd)
    Note that the libsdd is header-only, and as such it does not need to be
    compiled.
  - Boost >= 1.54

  * Tools
  - cmake >= 2.8.10

# Compilation

  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake /path/to/pnmc -DLIBSDD=/path/to/libsdd -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
